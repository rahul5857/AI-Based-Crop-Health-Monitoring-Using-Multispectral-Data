# AI-Based-Crop-Health-Monitoring-Using-Multispectral-Data
This project uses vegetation indices derived from drone multispectral data to analyze crop health. A machine learning model is trained to identify stressed and healthy crop areas and generate risk-based zones. The system helps in early detection of crop stress and supports better agricultural decision-making and targeted field monitoring.
